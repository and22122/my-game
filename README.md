# my-game in Godot

My project is built with the Godot game engine, which I've been learning for this sprint.


## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Download and setup Godot.
2. Download the files from GitHub.
3. If it doesn't run, you may need to start by building a project in Godot and then adding the files.

Instructions for using the software:

1. Open Godot. If you haven't already, setup the project.
2. Run the program. The main scene should be "backdrop.tscn".
3. Have fun!

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* Godot- I think that's it. If I remember correctly, the IDE and language were part of the same download. If not, there should be instructions on the Godot website.

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* [Your first 2D game with Godot 4](https://www.gdquest.com/library/first_2d_game_godot4_vampire_survivor/)
* [(Beginner Tutorial) Creating Platforms and Level Backgrounds in Godot] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9jFkosIGsg)
* [Godot Engine - Free and open source 2D and 3D game engine] (https://godotengine.org/)
I also used some of the tutorials on the Godot and GDQuest websites.

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] One of the tutorials I found made everything modular. It can be nice, but I ended up with too many files.
* [ ] I need to finish the card system.
* [ ] It would be nice to rescale things. The actual canvas is only 320 by 180 pixels.
